Overview
========

The Australian Geoscience Data Cube provides an integrated gridded data analysis environment for decades of analysis 
ready earth observation satellite and related data from multiple satellite and other acquisition systems.

In 2014, Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the NCI established the Australian Geoscience Data Cube, building on earlier 
work of Geoscience Australia and expanding it to include additional earth observation satellite and other gridded data 
collections (e.g. MODIS, DEM) in order to expand the range of integrated data analysis capabilities that were 
available. The complete software stack and petabytes of EO are deployed at the NCI petascale computing facility for 
use by NCI users.

__The current AGDC v2 implementation is intended as a working prototype__ for a cohesive, sustainable framework for 
large-scale multidimensional data management for geoscientific data. This public development release is intended to 
foster broader collaboration on the design and implementation. It is not intended for operational use.

Documentation
=============
See the [user guide](http://agdc-v2.readthedocs.org/en/develop/) for installation &amp; 
usage of the datacube, and for documentation of the API.

Requirements
============

### System
* PostgreSQL 9.5+
* Python 2.7+ or Python 3.5+

Developer setup
===============

1. Clone:

    * `git clone https://github.com/data-cube/agdc-v2.git`
    
2. Install the native libraries for [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) &amp; NetCDF4.
    * This depends on your OS.
      * Eg. `yum install gdal`
        
3. Install Python dependencies:

    `python setup.py develop`
    
    Note that the versions must match between GDAL's Python bindings and the native GDAL library. If you receive
    a gdal error when installing dependencies, you may need to install a specific version first:
     
     eg. `pip install gdal==2.0.1`
    
4. Run unit tests + PyLint

    `./check-code.sh` 
    
    (this script approximates what is run by Travis. You can alternatively run `py.test` yourself)
    
5.  **(or)** Run all tests, including integration tests.

   `./check-code.sh integration_tests`
    
   * Assumes a password-less Postgres database running on localhost called `agdcintegration`
     * Otherwise copy `integration_tests/agdcintegration.conf` to `~/.datacube_integration.conf` and edit to customise.
